# 3D Solar System – Keshav Gupta

This project is a mobile-responsive 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js.

##  Features

- The Sun and all 8 planets orbiting with correct spacing and speeds
- Realistic lighting and 3D planetary motion
- Background stars for realism
- Speed control panel for each planet
- Pause/Resume animation toggle
- Hover to highlight planets
- Click on planet to zoom in
- Planet labels

##  Setup

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Interact using mouse, and use the control panel.

##  Demo Guidelines

Record a 2–3 min video showing:
- The solar system in action
- Adjusting speeds using sliders
- Pausing/resuming motion
- Hover + zoom interactions
- Code walkthrough (mention `three.module.js`, animation loop, control panel code)
